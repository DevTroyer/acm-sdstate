It is used to develop and compile computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services, and mobile apps. It includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (a component that uses analysis to complete code for you as you type) as well as code refactoring. Other built-in tools include a code profiler, a designer for building GUI applications, a web designer, a class designer, and a database schema designer. It accepts plug-ins that enhance its functionality at almost every levelâ€” including adding support for source control systems (like Git). The most basic edition of Visual Studio, the Community edition, is available free of charge.'
